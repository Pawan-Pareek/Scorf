# File Upload Solution for GPS Application Portal - Final Implementation

## Problem Description

When users upload files from the portal using the organization information component, the uploaded files were not visible in the Notes & Attachments section of the Funding_Application__c record. This issue occurs because in the system, files are uploaded to Salesforce first, and then the associated record (Funding_Application__c) is created afterward.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **File Upload Before Record Creation**: Files are uploaded to Salesforce before the Funding_Application__c record is created, so there's no recordId available during the initial upload.

2. **Missing ContentDocumentLink Records**: The `lightning-file-upload` component should automatically create ContentDocumentLink records, but this wasn't happening reliably in the portal context, especially when no recordId is available.

3. **Portal Context Issues**: File uploads in Experience Cloud portals can have different behavior than in regular Salesforce orgs due to sharing settings and user permissions.

4. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The original implementation lacked proper error handling and validation for file uploads.

5. **Missing File Validation**: No validation was in place for file types, sizes, or limits.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced File Upload Handling with Pending File Management

**File**: `force-app/main/default/lwc/organizationInformation/organizationInformation.js`

- Added comprehensive file validation (type, size, count limits)
- Implemented pending file tracking for files uploaded before record creation
- Added file linking mechanism that works after record creation
- Enhanced UI with better file list display and delete functionality
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. Apex Controller Enhancements

**File**: `force-app/main/default/classes/GPSApplicationController.cls`

#### New Methods Added:

- `ensureContentDocumentLinks()`: Ensures ContentDocumentLink records are created for uploaded files
- `getContentDocuments()`: Retrieves existing files linked to a record
- `cleanupOrphanedFiles()`: Cleans up files that are not linked to any record

### 3. UI Improvements

**File**: `force-app/main/default/lwc/organizationInformation/organizationInformation.html`

- Enhanced file upload component with proper attributes
- Improved file list display with better styling
- Added file type and size restrictions
- Better visual feedback for upload status
- Added informational messages for pending files

**File**: `force-app/main/default/lwc/organizationInformation/organizationInformation.css`

- Added comprehensive styling for file upload section
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Visual indicators for success, error, and warning states

### 4. Parent-Child Component Communication

**File**: `force-app/main/default/lwc/gPSApplication/gPSApplication.js`

- Added notification system for record creation
- Implemented proper event handling between parent and child components
- Added method to notify child components when record is created

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Process

1. **User Uploads File**: User selects and uploads file(s) via `lightning-file-upload`
2. **Client-Side Validation**: Files are validated for type, size, and count limits
3. **File Storage**: Files are uploaded to Salesforce and stored in component state
4. **Pending File Tracking**: If no recordId is available, files are marked as "pending" for later linking
5. **Record Creation**: When the application is saved, the Funding_Application__c record is created
6. **File Linking**: After record creation, `ensureContentDocumentLinks()` method is called to create ContentDocumentLink records
7. **UI Update**: File list is updated and success message is shown

### ContentDocumentLink Creation

```apex
ContentDocumentLink link = new ContentDocumentLink();
link.ContentDocumentId = contentDocumentId;
link.LinkedEntityId = recordId;
link.ShareType = 'V'; // Viewer access
link.Visibility = 'AllUsers'; // Visible to all users
```

### File Validation Rules

- **Maximum File Size**: 5MB per file
- **Maximum Files**: 10 files per upload
- **Allowed Types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, TXT, JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF

### Pending File Management

The solution handles the scenario where files are uploaded before the record is created:

1. **File Upload**: Files are uploaded to Salesforce without a recordId
2. **Pending Storage**: Files are stored in the component's `pendingFiles` array
3. **User Notification**: User is informed that files will be linked when the application is saved
4. **Record Creation**: When the application is saved, the Funding_Application__c record is created
5. **File Linking**: The `setRecordId()` method is called, which triggers file linking for pending files
6. **Cleanup**: Pending files array is cleared after successful linking

## Testing Instructions

### 1. File Upload Before Record Creation Test

1. Navigate to the GPS Application portal
2. Go to Organization Information step
3. Upload a file using the file upload component (before saving the application)
4. Verify the file appears in the file list with a "pending" message
5. Save the application to create the record
6. Verify the file is linked and appears in Notes & Attachments

### 2. File Upload After Record Creation Test

1. Create a new application and save it to get a recordId
2. Go back to Organization Information step
3. Upload a file using the file upload component
4. Verify the file is immediately linked and appears in Notes & Attachments

### 3. File Validation Test

1. Try uploading files larger than 5MB
2. Try uploading unsupported file types
3. Try uploading more than 10 files at once
4. Verify appropriate error messages are shown

### 4. File Deletion Test

1. Upload a file
2. Click the delete button next to the file
3. Verify the file is removed from the list
4. Check that the file is also removed from Notes & Attachments

### 5. Portal Compatibility Test

1. Test file upload as a portal user
2. Verify files are visible to other users with appropriate permissions
3. Test file access across different user roles

## Deployment Notes

### Required Permissions

Ensure portal users have the following permissions:
- **ContentDocument**: Read, Create, Edit, Delete
- **ContentDocumentLink**: Read, Create, Edit, Delete
- **Funding_Application__c**: Read, Edit

### Sharing Settings

- ContentDocumentLink records are created with `Visibility = 'AllUsers'` to ensure visibility in Notes & Attachments
- ShareType is set to 'V' (Viewer) for proper access control

### Portal Configuration

- Ensure the Experience Cloud site has proper file upload settings enabled
- Verify that the portal profile has access to ContentDocument and ContentDocumentLink objects

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Appearing in Notes & Attachments

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify ContentDocumentLink records exist in the database
3. Check user permissions for ContentDocument and ContentDocumentLink
4. Ensure the recordId is properly passed to the component
5. Check if files are in pending state and need to be linked

### Upload Failures

1. Check file size and type restrictions
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Check Salesforce storage limits
4. Review debug logs for Apex errors

### Portal-Specific Issues

1. Verify Experience Cloud site settings
2. Check portal user profile permissions
3. Ensure proper sharing settings are configured
4. Test with different portal user roles

### Pending Files Not Linking

1. Verify the application was saved successfully
2. Check if the `setRecordId()` method was called
3. Review debug logs for file linking errors
4. Ensure the recordId is valid and accessible
